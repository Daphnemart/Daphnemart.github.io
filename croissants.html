		<h4>Ingredients</h4>
		<ul>
		<ol>
			<li>1 cup flour
			<li>2 teaspoons salt
			<li>2 tablespoons sugar
			<li>¾ teaspoon instant yeast
			<li>1 tablespoon evaporated milk powder
			<li>½ cup water
			<li>1 ¼ stick European style unsalted butter
			<li>1 egg, whisked
		</ol>
		</ul>
			<h4>Directions</h4>
		<ul style='text-align: left'>
		<ol>
			<li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, sugar, salt, and milk powder together with a spatula or 			your fingers.
			<li>Pour the mixture onto a workbench and make a well using the bowl.
			<li>Add water and instant yeast in the middle and mix with your fingers until the yeast 			dissolves.
			<li>Bring the flour little by little toward the middle with your fingertips, mixing until 			all of the flour is incorporated.
			<li>Knead the dough until it is smooth. It should no longer be sticky and should bounce 			back when gently pressed.
			<li>Cover the dough with a damp tea towel or plastic wrap and let it rest at room 			temperature (68 to 70 F) for 30 minutes.
			<li>Press the dough down and shape it into a flat rectangle, then store it in the freezer 			for 1 hour, followed by a minimum of 6 hours in the refrigerator.
			<li>In between a piece of parchment paper, roll out the butter until it is 8 x 6 inches.
			<li>Store it in the refrigerator until ready to use and the texture is cold and flexible.
			<li>Roll out the dough into a rectangular shape measuring 16 x 12 inches and dust it with 			flour to prevent it from sticking to the workbench.
			<li>Place the cold butter in the center of the dough and fold the dough toward the middle.
			<li>Dust the top and bottom of the dough with flour and roll it into a 24 x 8-inch 			rectangle.
			<li>Proceed with a book fold (aka a double fold, as if you are folding a book closed 			twice).
			<li>Wrap the dough with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
			<li>Dust the counter with flour and roll out the dough once again to 24 x 8 inches and 			proceed with a simple fold.
			<li>Wrap it with plastic wrap and store it in the refrigerator for another 30 minutes.
			<li>Now, roll out the dough into a rectangle about 0.1 inches thick, 20 inches long, and 7 			inches wide.
			<li>Cut the dough into six isosceles triangles and roll them into croissants.
			<li>Place the croissants on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
			<li>Whisk the egg and brush the croissants with the egg wash.
			<li>Transfer the tray to the oven with a bowl of hot water and proof for 2 hours at a 			temperature between 77 and 82 F.
			<li>Take the croissants out of the oven and preheat it to 350 F.
			<li>Apply a second layer of egg wash and bake the croissants for 18 minutes.
			<li>Serve warm.
